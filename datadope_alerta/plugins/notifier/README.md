# Notifier Plugin

The Notifier plugin is designed to receive alerts, process them, and compare them to contextual rules stored in a 
database. If an alert matches one or more of these rules, the plugin will create a dictionary of information from the 
rules, ordered by priority, and insert it into the alert. This information can help users to resolve the issue 
associated with the alert.

### ContextRule Object
The ContextRule object represents a single contextual rule that is stored in the database. It has the following 
attributes:


| Field name       | Type    | Function                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|------------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| id               | Integer | ID of the contextual rule, used to identify it (Unique, Autogenerated)                                                                                                                      |
| name             | String  | Name of the contextual rule, used to identify it (Unique)                                                                                                                                   |
| Priority         | Integer | An integer representing the priority of the rule. Rules with higher priority values are considered to be more important.                                                                    |
| last_check       | Boolean | If `True`, no other rules will be compared with the alert after this one                                                                                                                    |
| contextual_rules | Dict    | A list of dictionaries containing the information that has to be present into the alert for this rule to match it (some TAG that the alert should contain, or a specific value for a field) |
| context          | Dict    | Dictionary containing the extra information to be added to the alert if this rules matches it                                                                                               |
